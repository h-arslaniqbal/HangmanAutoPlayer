Limitation
	- cannot use solution or hint
	- maxwrongtries = 7

Algorithm:
1. All words in the guessList
	- call the url and get list of words
2. Start the game using '/hangman' POST api	
	Url: https://hangman-api.herokuapp.com/hangman
	Response:
	{ hangman: hangman_string, token: game token }

3. Store the token and extract tstring length
4. Extract words from guessList based on tstring length
5. Get max occurence character i.e. maxC
	- Creat a Dictionary for all Alphabets with 0 as occurences except those alpohabets whihc have value as -1
	- Iterate through the guessList and populate the occurences of each character based on their occurences in each word. Only consider the characters that have values > -1
	- get the character with max number of occurences i.e. maxC
6. Pass maxC to PUT Api 
  { token: storedToken, letter: maxC }
	Response:
		- refesh the token value 
		- extract the guess as true/false
		- update the occurences dictionary and set value of maxC = -1
7. Based on the true/false value:
	- Update the noofWrongTries and checkForHangman variable
	- If noofWrongTries < maxwrongtries OR the word is guessed correctly (the hangman varaible doesnot contain '_'){	
		- if false
			- reduce list by eleminating words that contain the letter
		- if true
			- reduce list  based on the words that contain that letter (*) (possibly regex)
		- Goto Number 5
	}
	else 
		- end
